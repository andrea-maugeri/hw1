For this task I created an interactive website resembling an information site where you can read the last news about cryptocurrencies. 
The contents are updated continuously and are provided by an external API (newsdata.io). You can add and remove an article to a favorites list and it is also possible search, listend and download a podcast related to a specific cryptocurrency.
There are also some extra features such as encrypted passwords, and a primordial mobile mode.
